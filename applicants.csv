After serving my community and supporting my family, I want to show up for myself and refill my cup. That’s why I’m hiking the AT this year: it’s a gift to myself. ","6 years ago, my dad was diagnosed with dementia. Initially, I was his primary caregiver for 6 months until I decided to move to Baltimore. In Baltimore, I built a beautiful life that I loved. One that was very different from how I grew up. I thought I’d never return home. Then my dad's condition worsened and my mom needed help, so after 3 years in Maryland, I returned to Pittsburgh. For the last three years, my mom and I have shared caregiver responsibilities and worked on our relationship by addressing past hurts. Moving back to Pittsburgh allowed me to be close to my dad, but was also an opportunity to face all of the things I ran away from. I had to make peace with my childhood marked by sexual abuse, family substance abuse, and moving literally every year. The past few years have a season of reckoning with my path and as I walk the AT, I want to cultivate my future. I want to show up for me like I show up for others in my life.","When I’m faced with challenges, I look to my source and my inner guidance. I find solace and grounding in my life’s mantra: that things are always working out for me. I do whatever I can to soothe myself with positive words and a shifted perspective. Once I find the feeling of relief, I’m often rewarded with clear guidance for a path forward. My courage often shows up when I need it most. After moving back to Pittsburgh I quit a great job at a global tech giant to grow food and do community outreach at my community farm. It was the greatest career I’ve made and bright me so much joy. ","I not much one for wishing but at the end of my hike, I hope to feel a sense of accomplishment for having showed up for myself day after day. I hope to see the value in making myself, my safety, my happiness, and wellbeing my number one priority. I hope to feel more at home in my body and to know that I can do hard things. ","I only just heard of this opportunity today, but it’s truly an incredible thing that you all have put together in Nate’s honor and I’m sure he would be proud.

These traumas have left me with C-PTSD, anxiety and many other challenges. I actively am in therapy doing EMDR but did not see big changes until I actively began hiking in 2019 and then backpacking in 2023. I am now working on section hiking the entire AT and working to encourage others with similar mental struggles or experiences to join me. I also use this experience to help me stay connected to the homeless families/individuals that I help. Feeling the cold or heat while I'm out helps me to remember that they are sleeping in very similar elements but without all of the gear.","I find inspiration in the trail and the connections I make while I'm on it. I feel complete peace and freedom when I'm on the trail. I have a confidence in my abilities and in trusting myself that I can carry into my ""everyday life"" with my kids and work. I found courage on the trail after doing GA in its entirety alone, for the first time. I had to work through mental struggles alone when I was tired and wanted to give up but found great comfort and celebration in others when I ended at a hostel and got to swap stories with thru hikers. ","I want to find more peace and healing from my traumas. I don't get a lot of time for myself. I am busy helping so many people secure housing, stability, transportation and other means necessary to have a good life that often times I never get a moment for myself to reflect and find peace. 

I also want to find more peace and healing in my family. I am the third oldest of eight siblings; I did not always choose right for myself but I am now.

When I read about the scholarship, who it is in memory of, its mission, and how many people it is has helped I felt compelled to apply. I am trying my best to be able to come up with the money on my own but I am still looking for work and I plan to leave for Georgia in late March 2026.","I have suffered from suicidal ideation from a young age. I did not have a drug problem until my mid to late 20’s. Drugs made me want to die even more than I already did before I found them. I have had multiple serious suicide attempts, two of which I should not have survived, my Higher Power had different plans for me I suppose.

I struggle to get out of bed a lot of days. Being sober and unemployed while living at home in early recovery is hard. Depression is lingering and at times debilitating.

My main motivation every day is training for the AT. My BPD can only be treated through DBT and active participation on my part to consciously change the thought patterns and behaviors that allow me to relapse and succumb to active addiction, suicidal ideation, and depression.

The Trail is an opportunity to face mental health issues and overcome them.","When I face obstacles, I find inspiration in the people who remind me why it’s worth pressing on; my family, my friends, and those who have been there before me and found the strength to keep going.  I draw strength from stories of resilience and help push myself through with mantras like “this too shall pass”

Music is also huge for me, I was raised with love and music being the spiritual foundation of my household. I am encouraged by songs that I can relate to and find meaning in.","I hope that once I am standing on Mount Katahdin that I am able to stand a little more proud and have less doubts about my abilities. I hope that I have found some direction by then, maybe that I have gained some knowledge of my Higher Power’s will for me.

I don’t want to expect too much from my hike.

I want to enjoy the journey, the suffering and the joy, and be humble when I get there.","My family is amazing and they are all rooting for me.

My older brother died in 2009, I was 15 and he was 16, we were best friends.

My parents turned to drugs that summer to numb their pain and all of our plans changed and we are all still trying to get our lives back together these 16 years later.

My mom got a liver transplant 3 years ago in October, she is 3 and a half years sober. My dad and i shared a sobriety date for a time until I relapsed. My dad will be 3 years sober in November. My younger brother struggles with alcohol and mental health problems. Him and I have been hiking together.

My family looks to me for strength and that is pretty overwhelming at times. I believe getting to spend this time with self, away from everyone I know and love, for the first time in my life is the experience that I need at this point in my journey.

I am starting my NOBO thru hike on March 27th, 2026 and this scholarship would allow me peace of mind and financial stability to accomplish that goal.

Last year I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and that diagnosis has given me a better understanding of my behaviors and provided me a roadmap of sorts to guide me in my recovery.

I crave connection and seek perspective every day. Life has not been easy but the challenges I faced have shaped the way I see the world and the way I carry myself through it. I look for meaning in my sufferings and remind myself that each step forward brings me further from the place I am leaving behind and closer to a life of purpose.

The outdoors have been a place of peace, growth, connection, and introspection for me from a young age. 
I see the Trail as an opportunity to sharpen my self discipline and strengthen my mental fortitude. Ultimately these skills will help me to find long term sobriety and general stability in my life.

The Trail is an opportunity to endgame in something bigger than myself and spend time connecting with self as well as my Higher Power. The idea of getting to spend such an extended period of time alone while acing untold obstacles and having the opportunity to face them all with a clean mind and healthy body excites me to my core.

Nate’s story reminds me much of my own and what can happen to someone young and with a world of possibilities gets hurt and suddenly loses their way. I suffered for many years after my injury and separation with alcohol addiction and have been extremely lucky that I wasn’t further consumed by it.,"The biggest hurdle that I’ve been facing for the last few years is the death of my best friend. In 2014 I was stationed at Ft. Carson Co and met Cole Wilson who was my soldier. For the years following we were inseparable and spent all day together. It wasn’t until 2019 that we had a falling out after with my depression in full swing and going through I divorce I had believed that prior infertility in my marriage may have included him as well. It didn’t, but ultimately it strained our relationship ship and I spent the next several years reaching out and waiting. It wasn’t until late 2023 that we finally reconnected, but by that time Cole had been diagnosed with brain cancer and had withdrawn. Cole lost his fight in 2024 and I haven’t been the same since. Most of my days I’m still reminded of him and am filled with regret, thinking back to spending Winters in Colorado hiking, snowboarding, or driving around in the snow. If I had the opportunity to push pause on my life without feeling like I was abandoning my responsibilities, I think spending time on a trail thinking about Cole would be life changing.","I don’t believe in a higher power, although I wish I did at times. When things get tough I think about the people that I’ve lost and how they lived and try my best to live for them too.  I wouldn’t say I’m the most courageous person, but when I face something uncertain I’ve tried very hard to jump in with both feet. With school, with my job, with my now relationship with my wife.

Since 2023 my dream has been to hike the AT. My only obstacle is the financial part. I am hoping that winning this scholarship will help to finally be able to hike the trail in its entirety.,"As I mentioned in the question above, I suffer from depression. I’ve had depression off and on since COVID. Sometimes I feel like I am just stick in a whirlwind and can’t get out. Being outdoors is the only thing that truly makes me happy. I live in North Carolina so when I get to the point where depression is getting the best of me, I head for the trails. Being on the trails helps me to get out of my mind. It helps me to focus on positive thoughts. It helps me to forget all the troubles of this world. I am praying that being on the trail for 5-6 months will help with my depression. I am praying that being out on the trail will give me a new perspective on the way life should be lived. Being on the trial will allow me to be in a place and space that I love and am at my happiest.","When faced with challenges I find inspiration from my Lord Jesus Christ. I find inspiration from somewhere deep down in my soul that only God can give me. I pray and I meditate and I ask God to give me the strength and courage I need to overcome this challenge and so far HE has never failed me. 
At the age of 52 I have overcome so many challenges. I was a poor kid growing up in the ghetto. I was physically abused as a child and was told I would be nothing when I grew up. I got pregnant and had my first child at 19. So every day was a challenge for me. I overcame all of those challenges and worked to pay my way through nursing school. I became a nurse to help people and I love doing it everyday. Even when depression has me so down that I don’t want to be around other people, I go to work and smile because I know that God put me in this career to help others at their most vulnerable times. So my courage surprises me every single day that I go out not feeling my best but I still give my very best to any and everyone that needs me.","I wish to find myself.

My life has been affected by addiction since the beginning.  I come from two addict parents, and had to be the adult from a young age.  The cummulative stress from that lead me to my own decades long battle with alcoholism.  After many cycles of sobriety and relapse I am coming up on four years free from alcohol and am only now beginning to feel safe enough to think about what I want to be when I grow up.  I’m 41.  Fitness has been my savior through this process.  Pushing my physical body to its limits is something that has kept me grounded and willing and able to push on through the mental/emotional pain.  I grew up in East Tennessee, the Smoky Mountains are my home.  Post quarantine 2020, I decided to move to Maine because I have family here and have always been In love with the amazing nature it provides.  Two years ago I decided I wanted to drop everything and finally take the plunge to do my thru hike. My plan is to do a SOBO and “walk home”. Katahdin to Springer Mountain ( home being TN)  I pushed through the fear of logistics, the fear of “how do I just put life on hold?” “How will I finance this?”  I’m not a woman of means, and the AT just always seemed like it was for more privileged people, another thing that was off limits to me. ( limiting beliefs I know)
Unfortunately for me, I had some medical/dental stuff come up that wiped out any of the money I had saved up to do the hike.  I felt very defeated, but kept training and hiking because I just “know” I’m supposed to be doing this.
So I’m 41 now, in great physical shape, I have some new super expensive teeth so that’s good.  And I would be so grateful to be given this chance at fulfilling a dream.","I find inspiration through past versions of myself.  I find inspiration from others in recovery.  I find inspiration from the deep, unending well

My courage surprises me every day, to be honest.  It takes courage to even fill out this form.  Being human is scary- it takes a lot of courage to just show up in daily life.  For me, those every day victories are the things that keep me inspired.  I know it will require a lot of courage to attempt this hike, and for that, I have a LOT of courage.

I like to keep up with the community through Reddit and came across a post sharing Nate’s story and the idea behind the scholarship. It honestly brought tears to my eyes. Going through something incredibly difficult, especially as a young adult, alters you in a way most can’t understand. I resonated strongly with Nate’s story and the testimonials, which made me feel seen. I think it’s incredibly beautiful to honor their struggles and triumphs through this scholarship.

Truthfully I did not expect to survive, but three years later I am done with treatment, hopefully for good.

Munachi,Udenyi,mudenyi02@gmail.com,600 C-Bar Ranch Trail Unit 89,Cedar Park ,TX - Texas,78613.0,United States,17572752012,"I am applying for the Appalachian Trail because it has been my dream to thru-hike it. Unfortunately, I cannot afford to do so right now. I have invested a lot of money into preparing for and taking the MCAT, and I also need to save for medical school applications, which cost thousands of dollars. Even though I currently have the time to hike the trail, I don’t have the financial means. Still, I know that one day I will complete the Appalachian Trail—it’s only a matter of when. Life isn’t guaranteed, and I don’t want to keep putting off something that means so much to me.
","I struggle with food addiction. It’s something I’ve faced for a long time and continue to struggle with. I know it’s likely something I will always be working through in some way.
As a kid, my family used to joke about how much I loved food. They weren’t wrong. I’ve always derived a deep sense of satisfaction from food, definitely more than the average person. When I attended Valley Bible Church in Hercules, California during middle school, I volunteered in the kids’ ministry mostly so I could enjoy the cinnamon rolls they served. I would sneak away from Kumon (learning center for children) in Pinole just to go to Krispy Kreme, try seasonal Oreo flavors at Walgreens, or sample new Lays “Do Us a Flavour” chips at 7/11. My love for food  was pretty innocent then and did not have much health consequences. I was active, played basketball, and although I was chubby, it didn’t stop me from having fun when I was young.
That changed when I was 17. A major family situation forced my mom to relocate us from California to Virginia. It was the most difficult experience of my life. My mom was working long hours. My older brother returned to California for college, and my younger sister had just started middle school. I was completely alone in a place I had never even visited before. In California, I had never been very popular. I was a fat, geeky Black girl who liked trying strange snacks, but I had grown up there and had friends there since I was very young. In Virginia, I had no one and I knew no one. That intense loneliness became the foundation of my food addiction.
I wasn’t in many classes, so I didn’t attend school regularly. I got a job at Walmart and used my paychecks to feed my addiction. Food became my comfort and my only real source of happiness. What had once been a quirky love of food turned into something much darker. In just three months, I gained 80pounds.
Eventually, my mom encouraged me to join the basketball team. This helped a little. I had more structure, movement, and fewer opportunities to binge out of boredom. But then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Between February 2020 and January 2021, I spiraled again. Without school or consistent work, I had too much time and too many emotional triggers. I gained 80 more pounds. Right before starting college, I tried to lose weight through extreme methods. I tried keto and even fasted for seven days at a time. It might sound contradictory for someone who binge eats, for some reason I could settle in extremes for very short periods of time. I had some success, but I was young and did not realize the importance of sustainability in pursuing health.This dietary pattern just resulted in worse binges. One memory I have is of ending my 7 day fast with Taco Bells and a donut ice cream sandwich from Donutz on a stick in Yorktown, Virginia.
Over time, I experimented with more strategies, like combining very low-calorie diets with long-distance walking. These attempts were still extreme and led to more cycles of bingeing and restriction. But one unexpected thing stood out. Walking made extreme dieting easier. Walking long distances eased my urges. It gave me something to focus on and made me feel in control again. During this period of experimentation with my body,  I found that having a distance goal was much more enjoyable than walking for a set amount of time. Mentally it was easier to tell myself to walk 10 miles to the grocery store in comparison to telling myself to walk for 1 hour. If I walked 10 miles to reach a destination filled me with adrenaline and excitement. Unfortunately, I did not connect the dots and use this discovery to make sustainable healthy changes in my life instead I used it just as a means to make torture easier. 
At the end of my sophomore year of college, my cousin passed away from a blood clot. This triggered intense health anxiety for me. I made the decision to leave college for a year and live with my mom in hopes of finally addressing my eating disorder and more importantly in my head then losing weight rapidly.A year prior to this, my mom lost her job and moved to Austin, Texas so my family was no longer in Virginia. Looking back, I realize that this was not the best decision. My parents were emotionally distant, and moving to a new city where I didn’t know anyone besides my mother and my sister put me back into a familiar cycle of isolation. Still, I’m no longer angry at my 19-year-old self for choosing what felt right at the time. I now look back on that year with gratitude. I struggled again with loneliness, but it was then I was able to connect the dots and realize my love for walking, not just as a tool for weight loss.
Before returning to school in the fall of 2023, I made one last extreme attempt to lose weight by walking 20 miles every day for a month. Unsurprisingly, it ended with overuse injuries after three weeks. But it was during that time, while searching Reddit for advice on long-distance walking, that I discovered the subreddit r/AppalachianTrail.
That discovery changed everything. Here I was walking 20 miles a day for absolutely no reason but a desire to lose weight. In contrast to the thru hikers that were getting ready to submit to Mount Katahdin, I became obsessed with trail life and the stories I found. While I was walking around my neighborhood with random distance goals, thru-hikers were moving with clear direction, heading toward a summit. I started to dream about doing a thru-hike myself. I would tear up watching people as they submitted Mount Katadhin, the thought of hiking the Appalachian Trail carried me through the rest of my unrealistic walking plan. It was then that I realized. For me, walking made me very happy. It didn’t just make dieting more tolerable because there was less time to eat. I, Munachi, enjoyed walking. I started incorporating walking into my life in a healthier way. I stopped using it as punishment. It gave me peace in my body, and for the first time, I stopped trying to harm myself to fit society’s beauty standards. I no longer pursue extreme diets. Now, I try to eat clean and move freely. Since August of 2023, I have lost 140 pounds going from 350 to 210. I am still fat, but I am healthy and I can move freely. My blood pressure is no longer high, I no longer have prediabetes.  
Struggling with addiction, whether to substances or food, is not a straight path. It’s complicated, emotional, and often isolating. That’s what makes this question so difficult to answer. I’ve faced binge eating, but I’m also still facing it. With some addictions, like alcohol or drugs, you can abstain completely. With food, you can’t stop eating. What I’ve learned is that walking gives me a kind of compassion that’s similar to the feeling food once gave me. It gives me purpose and dopamine in a healthier way. The thought of walking for months on the Appalachian Trail excites me deeply. The Appalachian Trail isn’t just a longer version of the walks I do every day. It is an American pilgrimage. It’s a space where others are walking their own difficult paths. Walking was once something I used to punish my body to make it smaller, it is now something that I do to experience simple joys in life and to see the beauty of the World. Everyday on trail, I would be doing something I already love with a true goal at the end.. Thank you for reading. I am sorry that it is really long.","I find inspiration in people who have faced the same challenges I am currently dealing with. In any challenge, my first step is to speak to someone that has overcome said challenge. This has helped me personally a ton. When someone asks me for advice, I try to respond from my own life experience and the lessons I have learned along the way. I do the same when talking to myself. When I feel the urge to self-isolate, when I get anxious about my appearance, or when I believe I should not do something because of my weight, I remind myself that giving in to those feelings has never worked out for me in the past.That mindset is what helps me stay courageous and take action, even when I feel unsure or uncomfortable. It has led me to try things I knew I might not succeed at, simply for the experience and the joy of doing them. Last spring, I competed in a climbing competition at my school. Climbing is a sport where being lean offers a big advantage, and I knew I did not have that. I also knew I probably would not win. But I still showed up and competed. I surprised myself by not only participating but actually having fun. For me, courage is not about winning or being the best. It is about not letting fear or shame decide what I can or cannot do.

Ashley,Thorpe,thevintagedietitian@gmail.com,PO BOX 114,Sigel,PA - Pennsylvania,15860.0,United States,18145731070,"Initially I saw this scholarship posted on Reddit in an Appalachian Trail group. I opened your website with no intentions of actually applying. I’ve never applied for a scholarship before because I never felt like I was worthy of winning it, and nothing in other scholarships ever resonated with me.
 
The love with which you speak into the life Nate lived is so beautiful. Just getting to read his story, and about the incredible life he lived is fantastic. The way you describe him is what drew me to actually apply. I hope that if I am chosen for the scholarship, I’ll be able to take a little piece of Nate’s story along the trail with me and spread his light just a little farther and a little longer; and if I’m not, I know that those you choose will take that light with them (maybe I’ll even meet them along the trail and Nate will hang out in the conversations we have).","I feel like my whole life has been a bit of a challenge. I am very lucky that I am not someone who suffers from a substance abuse disorder, but I did grow up in households with family members who suffered. I experienced a lot of trauma in the first two decades of my life and I’ve been trying to figure out how to heal from it since then.
I’m so blessed to have a loving and supportive spouse, sister, and so many friends and church members which have helped me, but I still have something underlying that needs to heal.

I felt the calling from the trail 6 years ago, and it hasn’t let me go. Next year is when I finally have the time to get out there, and I’ve dedicated that time to being intentional about facing the things that I’ve buried without the distraction of the rest of the world. I’m seeking trauma therapy now in preparation for the spring so that I’m fully prepared to meet myself in the peace and solitude of the trail.","I mostly find inspiration in God when I’m facing challenges. Knowing that I am on this planet for a purpose helps to get me through when it feels impossible. Knowing that I was not guaranteed a life without suffering, and that the suffering is helping to prepare me for something doesn’t make it easier, but it helps me to know that I will make it through. 

I don’t know that my courage has ever surprised me. I think I’ve always been a courageous person. I have had to do hard things my whole life, and I know that if I am convicted to do something it means that I will get whatever I’m meant to get out of it even if I fail. Maybe the most courageous thing I have done is apply for this scholarship, because I am needing to be rather vulnerable about admitting that I am struggling with my mental health right now. I suppose it also surprised me a little bit when I sought help from a therapist and actually admitted how I was feeling underneath the put together person I want to be.
","The first thing I will likely wish for myself at the end of the hike is a long, hot shower and a big juicy steak. 

After that, I really wish that the hike was not made in vain. 
I wish for my future self to have some semblance of peace in my soul, more compassion for myself, and maybe the courage to slow my regular life at home down a little bit so that I can keep that peace. I also wish to be someone who can help future hikers better than I can now because I’ll have some experience to help relate to them better. ","I can’t think of anything else to share. I know you have a really tough decision to make, and I wish you all the peace in choosing the people you feel Nate’s legacy will help the most. I appreciate that you are considering me, and even if I’m not chosen I thank you for sharing Nate’s story with me.

However this also plays a huge role in depression, overthinking, anxiety and a whole slew of other problems and it begins to eat you alive.

I suffered from chronic depression leading up to 2018 on my thru hike of the PCT and nearly took my life several times. That was the idea initially for hiking the PCT as it was a way to distract my family into thinking I finally found a purpose in life and that I found what made me happy. I had a long drawn out plan for the PCT that would make it look like an accident happened and that was how I imagined it. 

The trail saved my life on day 1. The people I met on day 1 brought a feeling I had never felt before. Safe, included, loved, seen. Each day after that my depression slowly dissipated and I fell in love with the community, the outdoors, the trail life, and life in general. I was a long haul trucker before the trail and could barely walk, much less hike. The first day on trail was brutal, 11 miles for the day, ran out of water by midday, and eventually met up with my tramily who were all in the same boat. We were all miserable, unprepared and disorganized and I finally felt like I wasn't alone.

Fast forward to now, it has been 6 years since my last thru-hike on the Colorado trail and this happiness is wearing thin. I stumbled back into my old rhythm and know the only thing that ever worked before was a thru-hike. 

Im currently in the process of selling everything I have, paying off all my debt in hopes to hike the AT the PCT and do a thru-float on the Mississippi River in 2026. With current calculations I will have a mere $3000 for it all but even without assistance my mind is set on getting my life back in check. I have never found anything else that works for happiness that actually works besides hiking.

I am also not interested in social media as I know that has been a huge role in getting me into this funk. There is no personal relationships, everyone is divided on ever subject and I plan on permanently deleting all but one social media page that I will be using for blogging for the trek. I feel like what I want is actual communication, growth, and to free myself from the social norms that really isn't normal. I want to have 1 on 1 conversations in person whether gsce to face or a phone call. Its personal and  shows the emotions that texts do not. On dayb1 onnthebAT I plan on deleting social media with a post highlighting what I want and to leave my phone number for anyone that truly wants to be in my life, otherwise the trail is my life and the people that inhabit the trail.

I plan on Journaling everyday writing everything down and once a journal is full I am sending to a pen pal I have never met but she has accepted that she will hold onto them until my journey is complete. I plan on writing a book upon completion of my goals and what I learned along the way as well as show insights to others that might feel the same way. Im socially expired by social media and looking forward to the trail providing the life in remembered and loved from the PCT. One step in front of the other and one positive moment after another. The trail provides and I have to be willing to let it work its magic on me.",November 24 2025Amanda,Jones,funkmeblind@gmail.com,92 county road 658,Hanceville,AL - Alabama,35077.0,United States,12568876043,my soul feels the need to hike the entire AT or as far as I can go.
