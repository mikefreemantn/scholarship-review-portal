## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Welcome to the One More Day on the AT Scholarship Review Portal. This system makes it easy for our board members to review applications, collaborate with notes, and cast their votes—all in one secure, user-friendly platform. Let me walk you through exactly how you'll use this as a board member."

---

## Getting Started: Your Invitation (45 seconds)

"First, you'll receive an email invitation to join the review board. This email comes from our system and includes:

- A link to the portal at voting.onemoredayontheatapply.com
- Your username (which is your email address)
- A temporary password

When you first log in, you'll be prompted to change this temporary password to something secure that you'll remember. Once you've set your new password, you're ready to start reviewing applications."

---

## The Welcome Page (1 minute)

"After logging in, you'll land on the Welcome page. This is your home base and includes:

- An overview of the review process
- Step-by-step instructions on how to review applications
- Important information about our two AI tools—which I'll explain in detail shortly
- Voting guidelines to help you evaluate candidates fairly
- The voting scale we use: 0-10, where 9-10 represents exceptional candidates who truly embody Nate's spirit

Take a moment to read through this page—it's a great reference to come back to if you have questions during the review process."

---

## Navigation Overview (30 seconds)

"At the top of the portal, you'll see three main navigation tabs:

1. **Welcome** - The page you're on now with all the instructions
2. **Applicants** - Where you can search across all applications using AI
3. **Review & Vote** - Where you'll review individual profiles and cast your votes

Let's explore each of these."

---

## The Applicants Page: AI Search Across All Applications (2 minutes)

"Click on the 'Applicants' tab. This is where our first AI tool lives—the All-Applicants AI Search.

This powerful feature lets you search across the entire applicant pool by asking natural language questions. For example, you might ask:

- 'Who has hiking experience on the Appalachian Trail?'
- 'Who mentioned financial need?'
- 'Who has overcome significant challenges?'
- 'Who is from Massachusetts?'

Let me demonstrate. I'll type: 'Who has hiking experience?'

[Type the question and click search]

The AI analyzes every single application and returns matching candidates as clickable cards. Each card shows:
- The applicant's name
- A brief explanation of why they match your search

Notice how the AI explains its reasoning—it's not just returning random results. It's actually reading through all the applications and finding relevant matches based on what applicants wrote in their essays.

If I click on any of these cards, it opens that applicant's full profile in a new tab, so I can review them in detail.

This is incredibly useful when you want to compare applicants on specific criteria or find candidates who share certain characteristics. The AI has read every word of every application, so it can find connections you might miss."

---

## Review & Vote: The Main Review Interface (3 minutes)

"Now let's move to the 'Review & Vote' tab—this is where you'll spend most of your time.

Here, you're viewing one applicant at a time. This focused approach helps you give each candidate your full attention without being influenced by others.

### The Applicant Profile

At the top, you'll see:
- The applicant's name and contact information
- Their location
- Navigation buttons to move between applicants

Below that, you'll see their complete application, including:
- Their personal statement about why they're applying
- Their essay about challenges they've faced and how the trail will help
- Where they find inspiration and courage
- Their hopes for the journey
- Any additional information they wanted to share

### Video Applications

If an applicant submitted a video introduction, it appears automatically at the top of their profile. These videos give you additional insight into their personality and passion for the trail. Not all applicants will have videos—it's optional—but when they do, they're embedded right here for easy viewing."

---

## AI Chat: Your Personal Research Assistant (2 minutes)

"Scroll down and you'll see the AI Chat section. This is our second AI tool—the Individual Applicant AI Assistant.

This AI has read this specific applicant's entire profile and can answer questions about them. It's like having a research assistant who's memorized their application.

You can use the starter prompts for quick insights:
- Click 'Overview' to get a summary of their application
- Click 'Strengths' to understand what makes them stand out
- Click 'Financial Need' to learn about their financial situation

Or you can ask your own questions. For example:

[Click 'Overview' button]

Watch as the AI provides a comprehensive summary of this applicant's story, pulling from all parts of their application.

Let me ask a custom question: 'What challenges has this person faced?'

[Type and send]

The AI responds with specific details from their application. This is incredibly helpful when you're reviewing many applications and need to quickly understand key aspects of each candidate.

**Important note:** The AI is a tool to help you gather information faster, but you should always read the full application yourself. The AI helps you research, but you make the final judgment."

---

## Board Member Notes: Internal Collaboration (1.5 minutes)

"Below the AI Chat, you'll find the Notes section. This is where you can leave private notes for yourself as you review.

These notes are:
- **Internal to you only** - Other board members cannot see your personal notes
- Helpful for remembering key points about each applicant
- Useful for comparing candidates later

For example, I might write: 'Strong connection to the trail. Mentioned section hiking in the Smokies. Financial need is clear.'

[Type and save a note]

These notes stay with the applicant's profile, so when you come back later, you'll remember your initial impressions. This is especially helpful when you're reviewing 20+ applications and need to keep track of your thoughts."

---

## Casting Your Vote: The Blind Voting System (2.5 minutes)

"Now, the most important part—casting your vote.

Scroll down to the Voting section. Here's what makes our system unique and fair:

### Blind Voting

Notice that you **cannot see** other board members' scores before you vote. This is intentional. We use a 'blind voting' system to ensure:
- Your judgment isn't influenced by others
- Each vote is independent and authentic
- We get diverse perspectives from all board members

You'll rate this applicant on a scale of 0-10:
- **0-3:** Does not meet criteria
- **4-6:** Good candidate with solid application
- **7-8:** Strong candidate with compelling story
- **9-10:** Exceptional candidate who embodies Nate's spirit

Let me select a score—I'll give this applicant an 8.

[Select score of 8]

### Vote Confirmation

Before I submit, the system asks me to confirm. This is because:

**Once you vote, it's locked in. You cannot change or undo your vote.**

This ensures the integrity of the process. You should take your time, read the full application, use the AI tools to research, and only vote when you're confident in your decision.

[Click 'Submit Vote']

### After Voting

Once I submit, notice what happens:
- A green checkmark appears next to this applicant's name
- The voting section is replaced with a confirmation message
- I can now see the average score from all board members who have voted
- I can see who else has voted (but not their individual scores)

This transparency helps you track the overall progress without revealing individual votes before you cast yours."

---

## Navigating Between Applicants (1 minute)

"At the bottom of each profile, you'll see Previous and Next buttons. These let you move through applicants one at a time.

The system remembers where you are, so if you log out and come back later, you can pick up right where you left off.

You can also jump to specific applicants by:
- Using the Applicants page AI search to find candidates
- Clicking on any applicant card from search results

Green checkmarks throughout the system show you which applicants you've already voted on, making it easy to track your progress."

---

## Best Practices for Board Members (1.5 minutes)

"Let me share some best practices as you use this system:

### 1. Read the Full Application
The AI tools are helpful for research, but always read the complete application yourself. The AI helps you understand faster, but you make the final judgment.

### 2. Use Both AI Tools Strategically
- Use the **All-Applicants Search** to find candidates with specific qualities
- Use the **Individual AI Chat** to dig deeper into each applicant's story

### 3. Take Notes
Leave notes for yourself as you review. When you're comparing 20+ applicants, these notes are invaluable.

### 4. Vote Thoughtfully
Remember, you can't change your vote once it's submitted. Take your time. If you're unsure, use the AI to ask more questions, re-read sections of the application, or come back to that applicant later.

### 5. Vote Independently
Don't discuss scores with other board members before voting. The blind voting system ensures we get authentic, independent perspectives from everyone.

### 6. Watch the Videos
If an applicant submitted a video, watch it. These often provide insights you won't get from reading alone."

## Tracking Your Progress (45 seconds)

"You can always see your voting progress:
- Green checkmarks show completed votes
- The system tracks which applicants you've reviewed
- You can vote on applicants in any order—you don't have to go sequentially

Most board members find it helpful to:
1. First, use the AI search to explore the applicant pool
2. Then, systematically review each profile in Review & Vote
3. Use notes to track standout candidates
4. Vote when you're confident in your assessment"

---

## Questions & Support (30 seconds)

"If you have questions or encounter any issues:
- Refer back to the Welcome page for instructions
- The AI tools can help answer questions about applicants
- Contact the admin team if you have technical difficulties

Remember, this system is designed to make your job easier—helping you review applications thoroughly, collaborate through notes, and vote fairly."
